# Microcontroller Range and Detection System
This project was to develop an embedded system that captures the 3D model of a hallway using 100+ coordinates. I incorporated Stepper Motors, VL53LX Time of Flight Sensors, and MSP432E401Y Microcontrollers. I also integrated UART and I2C communication protocols to display the model on external devices.
